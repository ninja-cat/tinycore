This dir contains everything needed to create a working instance of
TinyCore Linux with any number of extensions in it.

To prepare everything, you should just run 'make'. It will download all
necessary distrs to downloads, populate tftpboot dir with everything needed to
boot from PXE including opt.cpio.gz containing everything in opt dir.
I recommend the first time run 'make -j4' so that downloads are run in
parallel.

To add some extensions, append a line to opt/tce/onboot.lst, make will download
it and add to opt.cpio.gz.

Any code that should be run on boot, should be placed at opt/bootlocal.sh. It
will run in background while there may be a tty session in the foreground
(which is suppressed by 'pause' in kernel cmdline).

To run a QEMU VM to test this, run 'make boot'.

If you want to log into it, use username 'tc', no password.
